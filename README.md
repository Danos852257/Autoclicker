# Autoclicker

There are currently four different ones
1. sword: Clicks every 0.625 seconds, the speed for a minecraft sword recovery. Good for afk farms 
   *Toggle by pressing r, quit the program by pressing escape 
2. spam: Spam clicks with a delay of 5 miliseconds because no delay was lagging my computer 
   *Hold down r to make it active, let go to make it stop. Quit by pressing escape 
3. legalSpam: Spam clicks with a more random delay to hopefully not get banned from whatever you use it for  
   *Same as Spam 
4. notAVirus: THIS IS A VIRUS. It randomly moves your mouse every 0.1 seconds and clicks wherever it was moved to.
   *Note: Press ESCAPE and the virus will stop.
